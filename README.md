- 👋 Hi, I’m @jevjams im a multipotentialite. Im a very hard worker. I enjoy playing the guitar, 3d printing and 3d designing using CAD software. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Html,css,java, and php. I want to make a 3d printing website to help me sell my 3d prints and take orders.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Html,css, I have a basic webpage set up for my 3D printing shop... but learning to get it launched and to function correctly is a challange for me at the moment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this while also making friend with the same intrest. ive been cheating a little bit and have used chatgpt to help me with my ideas but that has only taking me so far. Also im still new to learning how to use github.
- Im a Noob! If someone wants to take me under their wing and become friends or learn togeather that would be greatly appricated. I work a extreamly labours and dangrous day job, I want to develop these skills to advance my work situation and save myself.
- so if this striks a string with you lets hang out and play.
-                                                     -Jevjams!
